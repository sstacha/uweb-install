# uweb-install
These instructions are intended to get a development environment set up and running for the uweb website project on OSX.  For other OS's please insert instructions later per OS when needed.

cd to install directory: ie, ~/dev/projects/spe
CLONE THIS CODE TO YOUR NEW PROJECT DIRECTORY
git clone https://github.com/sstacha/uweb-install.git uweb
cd uweb

INSTALL DEPENDENCIES (TO BE RUN ONCE) 
--------
# pv not needed until database migrations
# INSTALL PV (used to give a % complete on the import)
# brew install pv

INSTALL pyenv
brew install pyenv
NOTE: don't forget to set your bash profile with
- add to profile: if which pyenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(pyenv init -)"; fi

INSTALL pyenv-virtualenv
brew install pyenv-virtualenv
NOTE: don't forget to set your bash profile with
- add to profile: if which pyenv-virtualenv-init > /dev/null; then eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"; fi

INSTALL latest 3.x version of python
pyenv install 3.6.2

SET GLOBAL ENV FOR TERMINAL IF NOT OVERRIDDEN
pyenv global 3.6.2

SET VIRTUAL ENV FOR speweb to point to the 3.x version
pyenv virtualenv 3.6.2 uweb

SET UWEB DIRECTORY TO USE THE UWEB VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
```
pyenv local uweb
NOTE: will create a .python-version file that will automatically set the environment when you cd to this direcotry or below and release when you leave
```

CREATE AND INSTALL UWEB PROJECT
--------
# todo: wrap this in an install script ./install-website.sh (creates the website folder with all code)
pip install django
pip install uwsgi

mkdir website
cd website

NOTE: if you are restoring from an existing codebase you can skip these 2 steps and instead: git clone git://github.com/youruser/somename.git docroot
django-admin startproject docroot .
NOTE: to copy including settings file
cp -R ../uweb_files/ docroot/
NOTE: to cpy without settings file
rsync -av --exclude='docroot/settings.py' ../uweb_files docroot

MANUAL STEPS TILL I CAN GET TO THIS:
    - backup existing file (see uarchvie project): archive -c docroot/settings.py
    - configure our settings file:
        Option 1: (make an existing settings file)
            rsync -av --exclude='docroot/settings.py' ../uweb_files docroot
            note: excluding settings file since people probably have modified that (try not to change this)
        Option 2: (work with the autogenerated one) **like this best
            - manually append docroot_settings.py to the bottom of settings.py
            - later create a admin command to do so
            - configure ALLOWED_HOSTS:
                - dev: ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
                - prod: ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['<machines to lock it down to']
    - generate our key
        - ./manage.py set_secret
        NOTE: if clustered
        - ./manage.py set_secret on first node
        - ./manage.py set_secret <secret_key from first node> on other nodes

## ---- didn't work
## setup the generated file to call ours
# echo "from django.contrib.auth.models import User; User.objects.create_superuser('admin@example.com', 'admin', 'admin')" | python manage.py shell
# sed -i 's/ALLOWED_HOSTS = \[\]/ALLOWED_HOSTS = \[\"\*\"\]/' docroot/settings.py
# echo 'from .docroot_settings import \*' >> docroot/settings.py

# note: if this has issues consider a management task that finds the code block and replaces it from the docroot_settings.py (had issues)
## ---- didn't work

./manage.py migrate
./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

NOTE: should work; test the docroot code
static file: http://localhost:8000/test.txt
static page no data: http://localhost:8000/test/
dynamic page static data: http://localhost:8000/test_static.html
dynamic page dyanmic data: http://localhost:8000/test.html

<ctrl><c> to stop

CREATE YOUR WEBSITE PROJECT FROM BASE UWEB CMS
--------
NOTE: if you already restored previously you obviously don't need to do any of this
1) Create the remote repository, and get the URL such as git://github.com/youruser/somename.git
(from website directory)
2) git init
3) git add .
4) git commit -m 'initial commit comment')
5) git remote add origin [URL From Step 1]
6) git push -p origin master


** IDEA: if I call data.dt directly intercept and return json context for quick web services. config for what dirs to apply since you don't want all data to automatically be a webservice if debug=false do we?

SCRIPTS (TO BE RUN PERIODICALLY) - The first time will set up; later will refresh. RUN EACH ONCE TO START WITH
--------

sync-code.sh (create to connect to repo and refresh our code, then copy it all except the settings file)
    - clones website if doesn't exist and pulls code
    - simply pulls and merges code if dir exists
    - sync-code.sh -f forces directory removal and does a new clone


sync-db.sh (create to remote scp sqllite.db file from prodcution to our local machine)
    - pulls the latest jenkins backup locally vis scp
    - deletes and recreates the django database from backup files
    
sync-files.sh
    - rsyncs files from production (only one copy with deltas)
    
    
NOTE: DO NOT PLACE THESE IN YOUR PATH.  I am using relative paths and the scripts expect to be run from the scripts folder.
    
INTEGRATION WITH IDE
----------------------
 - point ide to <home>/.pyenv/speweb/ or .../speweb/
 - point working folder to website/mainsite project folder (<installdir>/website/mainsite)
 - set the settings file (<installdir>/website/mainsite/settings/local)
 - say yes to build from existing sources
 - click the wrench or go to project properties
    - under languages and frameworks choose Django
        - enable django support
        - set project to <install dir>/website (ex: /Users/sstacha/dev/projects/spe/django/website)
        - set settings to mainsite/settings/local.py
        - should automatically set manage.py for manage script
    - under build, execucution, deployment
        - under Console choose Python Console
            - set working directory (ex: /Users/sstacha/dev/projects/spe/django/website)
            - set environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE to mainsite.settings.local
                - NOTE: should look like this when done: DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=mainsite.settings.local
            - check add source roots to have them autoload
        - under Console choose Django Console
            - set working direcotry (ex: /Users/sstacha/dev/projects/spe/django/website)
            - set environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE to mainsite.settings.local
                - NOTE: should look like this when done: DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=mainsite.settings.local
            - check add source roots to have them autoload
 - drop down the empty dropdown and choose run configurations
    - click the + and select django server
    - name it localhost (or whatever you like)
    - set working directory
    - leave everything else default
 - run -> localhost:8000 should show our homepage
 
 NOTE: if you see a msg about migrations to apply then open terminal and run ./makemigrations and ./migrate
